This is an adapter I modeled to hold the BALL TRANSFER UNIT KU-B8-OFK R053010810 from Bosch Rexroth.

The barrel of this model is 12.6mm in diameter, with a 17mm flange which presented some challenges in creating enough space and keeping the trackball the proper distance from the sensor.

This is one of my first design and modeling experiences, so hopefully someone else finds this useful!
